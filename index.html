            - Return to service after retirement.

            <strong>2293</strong>
            - A Klingon court sentenced Kirk to imprisonment in one of the mining colonies for the murder of the Klingon chancellor Gorkon. However, he was later released, which is Spock's merit, and the charge against him was dropped.

            <strong>2293</strong>
            - During the tests of the new Enterprise-V ship, Kirk disappeared (and, as expected, died). In fact, he got into a temporary anomaly, where he met Captain Picard from 2371 and helped him stop Tolian Soran, who decided to destroy 230 million lives.

          <li>

— Me too.""
